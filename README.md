# Service::WorkHours

Service::WorkHours is a simple service written in Perl to manage systemd
services that should run during a specific period every day.

systemd timers require creating units that start and stop the service, and in
the event the host is rebooted during the service activity period, it will not
be restarted automatically. This simple program solves this problem.

## INSTALLATION

First, build and test the distribution:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make dist

Install the distribution and all its dependencies using `cpanm`:

    cpanm Service-WorkHours-0.02.tar.gz

## USAGE

This module installs a `workhoursd` program which reads its configuration from
`/etc/workhoursd`, a YAML file that specifies which services should be managed.
Other options can be viewed using `workhoursd --help`.

Here is an example of configuration:

```yaml
---
services:
    nginx:
        start: 8:00  # Start at 8AM
        stop: 16:00  # Stop at 4PM
    my-service:
        start: 11:00
        stop: 12:00
        ignorefailed: 1 # Ignore the systemd failed state of the service

```

It is recommended to run `workhoursd` as a systemd service, which is enabled to
start at boot. ***It is recommended to leave managed services disabled as this
may cause conflicts at boot time with how `workhoursd` manages services***.

Here is a suitable `workhoursd.service` to run this program
as a service:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/workhoursd.service
[Unit]
Description=workhoursd daemon for managing services
After=local-fs.target
Requires=local-fs.target

[Service]
# Update this if you are not doing a system-wide install using cpanm
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/workhoursd
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
